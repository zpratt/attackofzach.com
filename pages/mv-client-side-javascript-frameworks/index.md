Since I chose to take the sysadmin career off-ramp (at least for now) back in April in order to explore my other passions as a full-time developer, I have been spending a lot of time re-[sharpening my proverbial programmer saw](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/sharpening-the-saw.html "Coding Horror - Sharpening the Saw"). Lately, I have become fascinated by the glut of client-side javascript frameworks and I have set out to find a few to experiment with (along with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) on the server side with a [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) backend). During my research today, I stumbled upon this very well-written article, which I felt compelled to share: [http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/) . Kudos to the author, [@stevesanderson](http://twitter.com/StevenSanderson), for doing such a great job of providing a straightforward comparison of the various frameworks/libraries.

Of the ones listed, [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/ "AngularJS") seems to appeal to me the most. Thoughts?
