In the past few years there has been a great deal of discussion on [alternatives](http://nosql-database.org/) to relational database systems. Data systems and information architecture have been a strong interest of mine for quite some time. Like many budding computer scientists, I was taught the fundamentals of relational database design during my [undergraduate studies](http://www.wiu.edu/cbt/computer_science/), but there was little discussion of alternative systems. Towards the end of my graduate studies, I decided to take the time to do a deep dive on alternatives to traditional relational database systems; mainly column-oriented datastores such as Google's BigTable, Amazon's Dynamo, and Facebook/Apache's Cassandra. I focused on these three, instead of systems such as [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) or [Riak](http://wiki.basho.com/), primarily because of the wealth of scholarly information about arguably the three largest deployments of alternative datastores.

Rather than keeping 4 months of research to myself, I thought I'd share with the community. I have included my research paper and a presentation I gave at the end of the semester to summarize my research.
