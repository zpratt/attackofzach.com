Since I'm six days away from officially completing my masters in [Computer Science](http://www.wiu.edu/cbt/computer_science/), I have some extra time on my hands. I've decided to take the easy way out and ditch Drupal for Wordpress and not write my own theme. The plan will be to focus on project management, Pentaho, linux, databases, and other random thoughts.

Here's a rundown of what I've been up to:

*   My wife and I had our first child back in November
*   I've spent the better part of the last 5 months researching NoSQL datastores for an Independent Study
*   I'm managing a data warehouse and Pentaho implementation at work
